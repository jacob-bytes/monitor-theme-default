 * Group tabs.

 * not something derived here. Nothing sends that field yet, so `groupNames` comes
 * back empty against a real hub and the tab row is not rendered at all: a lone
 * "全部节点" tab would be a control that cannot do anything, the same objection as
 * a total that only repeats the card above it.
 *
 * The field name has to match whatever the hub ends up calling it.
